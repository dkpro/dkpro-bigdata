## Introduction ##

DKPro BigData is a collection of components for text analytics using uima
on Apache Hadoop.

DKPro BigData facilitates data exchange between Hadoop and UIMA in various
ways.
It provides components to read collections using UIMA for processing using
Map/Reduce and vice versa.

Moreover it contains readers for some common WebArchive formats, which enable e.g. linguistic processing of CommonCrawl data.
