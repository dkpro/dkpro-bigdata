## InputFormats

DKPro BigData can read different kind of input data:

  * Plain Text using !Text2CasInputFormat
  * Our internal representation: SequenceFiles containing CasWritables (see below)
  * Web Archives
  * Any file we have a UIMa collection reader for

### Accessing HDFS from a CollectionReader

Since DKPro 1.5.0, all collection readers based on ResourceCollectionReaderBase support a
user-specified ResourceResolver. DKPro BigData provides a HDFSResourceLoader external Resource
that enables any DKPro Core  reader to read data directly from HDFS.


.CAS Serialization Formats
[cols="2*",options="header"]
|====
| CASWritable
| Using UIMA XMI (XML Serialization

| BinCasWritable 
| Using Binary Cas Serialization, very efficient

| BinCasWithTypeSystemWritable
| Prepends a Typesystem to every CAS, inefficient for small documents
|====

If you are sure that you will use *exactly* the same version and configuration of your components, or
as a intermediate format for shuffling, use !BinCasWritable. In every other case, BinCasWithTypeSystemWritable is recommended, it it also the default.
