## Creating co-occurence feature vectors

This package is a collection of pig and bash scripts that create vectors
of top-n cooccurences for a set of target words.

From those vectors, we can extract the rank of one word in respect to
the other and calculate a normalized similarity measure called RankRatio.

### Installation

The package requires 

* a working hadoop installation, including apache pig.
* <<sect:collocations,The DKPro Collocations package>>
* A corpus, in a DKPro BigData readable format
* https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/PIG/PiggyBank[PiggyBank] and http://engineering.linkedin.com/datafu/datafu-10[DataFu]
