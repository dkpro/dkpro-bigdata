    title: A collection of software components for natural language processing (NLP) based on the Apache UIMA framework.
    text: Many NLP tools are already freely available in the NLP research community. DKPro Core provides Apache UIMA components wrapping these tools (and some original tools) so they can be used interchangeably in UIMA processing pipelines. DKPro Core builds heavily on uimaFIT which allows for rapid and easy development of NLP processing pipelines, for wrapping existing tools and for creating original UIMA components.

How to cite
-----------

Many of the wrapped third-party components and the models used by them should be cited individually. We currently do not provide a comprehensive overview over citable publications. We encourage you to track down citable publications for these dependencies. However, you might find pointers to some relevant publications in the Model overview of the DKPro Core release you are using or in the JavaDoc of individual components.

Please cite DKPro Core itself as:
